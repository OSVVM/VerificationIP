Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology (OSVVM)
#################################################

Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology (OSVVM) provides utility and model libraries that simplify your FPGA and ASIC verification tasks. Using these libraries you can create a simple, readable, and powerful testbench that is suitable for either a simple FPGA block or a complex ASIC.

OSVVM is the #1 VHDL Verification Methodology
=============================================

According to the 2018 Wilson Verification Survey, OSVVM is the:

 * #1 VHDL Verification Methodology
 * #1 FPGA Verification Methodology in Europe (ahead of SystemVerilog + UVM)

The OSVVM Utility Library
=========================

The OSVVM utility library offers the same capabilities as those provided by other verification languages (such as SystemVerilog and UVM).   For more see: `OSVVM Utility Library <https://osvvm-utility.readthedocs.io/en/dev/>`_

The OSVVM Verification IP Library (aka Verification Components)
===============================================================

The OSVVM model library is a growing set of models commonly used for FPGA and ASIC verification.   For information more see: `Documentation Comming Soon <https://osvvm.github.io/>`_
